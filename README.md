## Welcome to my GitHub! 👋

Hello, my name is Davi Azevedo, and I am passionate about science and technology. Since writing my first lines of code in 2021, I decided to fully dedicate myself to a career in programming. 💻🚀

Since then, I have completed several courses and graduated from Trybe, where I developed skills that prepared me to work as a web developer. I currently work as a freelancer, specializing in building responsive web applications and collaborating with clients to create custom solutions. 🌟

You can check out my portfolio [here](https://daviazev.vercel.app/) to explore projects like a dynamic task management app and an e-commerce platform simulation. 🛠️✨

📚 In addition to programming, I am studying mathematics independently through Khan Academy. I have a strong interest in the subject and plan to start a Computer Science degree in the near future. 🔢🎓

🌱 **Fun Facts**:  
- 🎻 I played the violin for 9 years before transitioning to web development. 

Feel free to connect with me — I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations! 🤝
