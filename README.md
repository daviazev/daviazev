## Hello, I'm a web developer!

My name is Davi Azevedo, I always wondered what career I wanted for my life. I dreamed of being a lawyer, chemist and even a musician. However, it was with technology that I found the best space for me to make a difference. It was in my first "Hello World" that I decided how I was going to invest the years of my life.

Currently, I study full stack web development at Trybe, a programming school where we learn to develop and also to work.

Fun fact: I was a violinist for 9 years, and in that time I ended up becoming a teacher at the school where I studied.
