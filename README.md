## Welcome to my GitHub!

Hello, my name is Davi Azevedo and I am passionate about science and technology. Since I wrote my first lines of code in 2021, I knew what my biggest investment in the coming years would be: my career in programming.

Since then, I have taken several courses and today I am a graduate of Trybe, where I developed skills that enabled me to work as a web developer.

I currently work as a freelancer, but I am open to new opportunities. You can check out my portfolio [here](https://daviazev.vercel.app/) to see some of the projects I've worked on.

🌱 Fun Facts:

- I was a violinist for 9 years before becoming a web developer 🎻
- I have over 1100 days of streak on [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/profile/daviazev), and I'm currently learning Esperanto 🌎
